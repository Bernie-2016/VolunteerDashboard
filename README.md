# VolunteerDashboard

## Getting Started

`cd src/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7000`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:7000` on your browser.

## Deploying

### To the official dashboard

We are deploying the dashboard using Tutum and Docker. Any push to `master` will trigger a deploy.

### To your own server

You can deploy this to any server supporting Docker. A really simple and cheap way to do this is set up an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/), set up a [Tutum account](tutum.co), and then just follow the steps on Tutum.
