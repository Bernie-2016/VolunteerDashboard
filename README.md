## Getting Started

`cd src/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7000`

Then navigate to localhost:7000 on your browser

## Deploying

You can deploy this to any server supporting Docker. A really simple and cheap way to do this is set up an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/), set up a [Tutum account](tutum.co), and then just follow the steps on Tutum.
